## Notebook Installation

Refer to [Accessing the Challenges](https://github.com/donnemartin/coding-challenges#accessing-the-challenges), [Notebook Installation](https://github.com/donnemartin/coding-challenges#notebook-installation), and [Nose Installation](https://github.com/donnemartin/coding-challenges#nose-installation) to set up your local environment.

## Pull Requests

**Please follow the general [Repo Structure](https://github.com/donnemartin/coding-challenges#repo-structure) and [Notebook Structure](https://github.com/donnemartin/coding-challenges#notebook-structure) before submitting your pull request.**

### Adding Solutions to Existing Notebooks

If adding new solutions to existing notebooks:
* Append your algorithm and code solution rather than replace a fellow contributor's work
* Verify your code passes the unit tests

### Adding New Challenges

There are several sample coding challenges that are not yet implemented such as the examples below.
* These challenges are merely suggestions; feel free to send pull requests on different challenges, or even entire categories of challenges
* Try to keep the "Challenge" title relatively short and expand on the details within the notebook
* Check out the [template challenge and solution notebooks](https://github.com/donnemartin/coding-challenges/templates/) to help you get started

| Challenge | Static Notebooks |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Check if a number is prime | [Contribute](https://github.com/donnemartin/coding-challenges#contributing)│[Contribute](https://github.com/donnemartin/coding-challenges#contributing) |
| Generate a list of primes | [Contribute](https://github.com/donnemartin/coding-challenges#contributing)│[Contribute](https://github.com/donnemartin/coding-challenges#contributing) |

Update the list of challenges in the README so we can enjoy your challenge!

### Contributions in Languages Other than Python

Feel free to share your thoughts on how we could best approach adding challenges in other [supported languages](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPython-kernels-for-other-languages):
* Repo structure
* README static notebook links
* Installation instructions
* Etc

### Style

Please refer to the style of existing notebooks to help maintain consistency.  A consistently themed collection of notebooks might help users more seamlessly transition from challenge to challenge.

Review [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and the following [style guide](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html).

### Notebook Author(s)

When contributing to a notebook, update the notebook author(s):

<small><i>This notebook was prepared by [Joe](https://github.com/Joe) and [Jane](https://github.com/Jane). Source and license info is on [GitHub](https://github.com/donnemartin/coding-challenges).</i></small>
