## Pull Requests

**Please follow the general [Repo Structure](https://github.com/donnemartin/coding-challenges#repo-structure) and [Notebook Structure](https://github.com/donnemartin/coding-challenges#notebook-structure) before submitting your pull request.**

### GitHub Pull Requests Docs

If you are not familiar with pull requests, review the [pull request docs](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

### Notebook Installation

Refer to [Accessing the Challenges](https://github.com/donnemartin/coding-challenges#accessing-the-challenges), [Notebook Installation](https://github.com/donnemartin/coding-challenges#notebook-installation), and [Nose Installation](https://github.com/donnemartin/coding-challenges#nose-installation) to set up your local environment.

### Adding New Solutions to Existing Challenges

Challenges have multiple solutions.  If adding new solutions to existing challenges:
* Add your algorithm discusion and code solution to the existing notebook
* Update the unit test to include your solution
* Verify your code passes the unit tests

### Adding New Challenges

The README contains several sample challenges that are not yet implemented.
* The sample challenges are only suggestions, please do not limit yourself to only these topics
* Feel free to send pull requests on different challenges or categories of challenges
* Try to keep the "Challenge" title relatively short and expand on the details within the notebook
* Review the [Repo Structure](https://github.com/donnemartin/coding-challenges#repo-structure) and [Notebook Structure](https://github.com/donnemartin/coding-challenges#notebook-structure) sections
* Check out the [template challenge and solution notebooks](https://github.com/donnemartin/coding-challenges/templates/) to help you get started

| Check if a number is prime | [Contribute](https://github.com/donnemartin/coding-challenges#contributing)│[Contribute](https://github.com/donnemartin/coding-challenges#contributing) |
| Generate a list of primes | [Contribute](https://github.com/donnemartin/coding-challenges#contributing)│[Contribute](https://github.com/donnemartin/coding-challenges#contributing) |

Update the list of challenges in the README so we can enjoy your challenge!

### Update Notebook Author(s)

When contributing to a notebook, update the notebook author(s):

<small><i>This notebook was prepared by [Joe](https://github.com/Joe) and [Jane](https://github.com/Jane). Source and license info is on [GitHub](https://github.com/donnemartin/coding-challenges).</i></small>

### Maintain Consistent Style

Please refer to the style of existing notebooks to help maintain consistency.  A consistently themed collection of notebooks will help users more seamlessly transition from challenge to challenge.

Review [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and the following [style guide](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html).

### Contributions in Languages Other than Python

Feel free to share your thoughts on how we could best approach adding challenges in other [supported languages](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPython-kernels-for-other-languages):
* Repo structure
* README challenge list
* Installation instructions
* Etc
